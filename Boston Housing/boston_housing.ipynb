    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: \n",
    "I will divide the answer for each of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "'RM': There is an expected positive correlation between the number of rooms in a house and its price. The number of rooms in a house can be an indication of general house size and number of residents, both, intuitively, having a positive correlation to price. Although there is no information regarding the sizes for each room, which could implicate in a house with fewer but bigger rooms having a higher price than a house with more, yet, smaller rooms, it is expected that a larger number of rooms implies a more expensive house. Therefore, an increase in the value of this feature should lead to an increase in the value of 'MEDV'.\n",
    "\n",
    "'LSTAT': The expected correlation between the variables is negative, the higher the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\", the lower the price of the house. Assuming 'LSTAT' could be seen as an indication of the general aggregate income and thus buying power of some neighborhood, the higher the variable, thus lower buying power, the cheaper the houses at that area tend to be. In addition to that, I believe people are generally willing to pay a premium to live in \"good\" neighborhoods, meaning paying more for houses there, given that \"bad\" neighborhoods tend to have higher crime rates. Hence, an increase in 'LSTAT' should mean a decrease in 'MEDV'.\n",
    "\n",
    "'PTRATIO': I believe the expected correlation is also negative. Although not necessarily true, I believe that in general, a smaller student to teacher ratio tends to denote a better school/education. Given parents would generally rather live in their children's school general vicinity, those that have the means would be willing to pay a premium for living close to the better schools. Hence, assuming that a smaller ratio of students to teachers implies a higher quality school, the houses in the neighborhood of these better school should have higher demands and hence, higher prices.\n",

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "**Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "Chosen Graph: max_depth = 3\n",
    "As more training points are added, the training score goes down from 1 and converges to about 0.8, as for the testing score, the score goes up from 0 and converges towards 0.8 as well, having a more steep increase after an addition of the first 50 training points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, in machine learning, the more data points, the better. However, given that generally there is a cost to data and likely the processing power associated with it, an increase in the amount of data should be equated with the marginal increase in the model's improvement. Seeing as for this specific model the curves for the training and testing scores are already clearly converging at approximately 0.8, the marginal improvement to the model for the increment of more data points will be minimal. In the case in which there is some benchmark threshold for the score, once this convergence of both training and testing scores has been identified with a decent amount of precision, like the case for the graph at hand, this score could be used to either accept or reject the model. Extra data would only further validate an already established converged upon score and not greatly influence the decision, unless the score's uncertainty interval, accounting for the standard deviation, falls within the thresholds boundaries, and therefore perhaps more data could still be beneficial.\n",

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "At maximum depth of 1, the model is underfitted and thus suffers from high bias.\n",
    "With a maximum depth of 10 the model is overfitted, hence suffering from high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "With max_depth 1, the score of both training and validation are low, which imply the model is doing a poor job of fitting the data. At around a max_depth of 3, the model seems to be at its best \"fitting\" point, having a training and validation score at around 0.8, however from that point forwards, the scores diverge. The training score, as expected from the increase in max_depth, continuously improves and the validation score starts to decrease, albeit slowly, but further distancing from the training score. This indicates a sign of overfitting of the data, the model is increasingly accurate in predicting the training data but is also doing a worse job with testing scores.\n",

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

For all other maximum depths, the validation scores are smaller and data either indicates underfitting or overfitting.\n",

    "The grid search technique is used to identify what is the combination of hyper-parameters of some learning algorithm that gives the best result/score. For certain learning algorithms that have more than one parameter, a way of identifying what is the set of parameter values that best model the data is to create a grid of all the combinations possible and test out the model with each of the combinations, and identifying the combination that leads to the best scoring model through training and cross-validating each one. For example, with SVMs, two possible parameters are the Kernel, which can be Linear and Polynomial, and C, with is > 0. A grid search technique for both would be to set some specific C values, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, along one axis and the Kernel possibilities, Linear and Polynomial, along another one, and running the model with each of the possible combination and picking the one that had the best score.\n",

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
